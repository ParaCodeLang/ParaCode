### How to declare and use variables

To get started with variables,
use the `let` keyword. To use
`let`, we give the name we
want to be associated with
the variable, as well as an
optional type, such as `int`,
`float`, or `str`.

For example:

`let mynum: int = 5;`

Creates a variable named mynum,
with a type of `int`, and assigns
its value to 5.
