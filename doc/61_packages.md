### Packages

You might want to use an external package
to expand upon the ParaCode codebase.

Let's get started by showing how to install
a package.

You can install a package with:
```shell
./PCPM install PACKAGENAME
```
You can also use `get` instead of `install`.

You can update an installed package with:
```shell
./PCPM update PACKAGENAME
```

You can uninstall a package with:
```shell
./PCPM uninstall PACKAGENAME
```
You can also use `remove` instead of `uninstall`.

You can publish a package with:
```shell
./PCPM publish PACKAGENAME VERSION
```
