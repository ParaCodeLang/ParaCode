### Packages

You might want to use an external package
to expand upon the ParaCode codebase.

This page expects you to already have
PCPM installed. In the future, you'll
be able to rerun the installer to install
it, but for now, you have to [compile it yourself](https://github.com/ParaCodeLang/PCPM).

Let's get started by showing how to install
a package with the ParaCode Package
Manager, or PCPM for short.

You can install a package with:
```shell
PCPM install PACKAGENAME
```
You can also use `get` instead of `install`.

You can update an installed package with:
```shell
PCPM update PACKAGENAME
```

You can uninstall a package with:
```shell
PCPM uninstall PACKAGENAME
```
You can also use `remove` instead of `uninstall`.

You can publish a package with:
```shell
PCPM publish PACKAGENAME VERSION
```
